## Hi, I’m Jairo 👋  
**Computer Science · Computational Social Modelling**

Software developer working primarily with **Java** and **Python**, with a strong interest in **mathematical and computational models of social systems**.

I studied **Computer Science** at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), but didn’t complete the degree.  
Currently focused on building **personal SaaS projects**, strengthening my **backend skills**, and exploring how **complex social dynamics** can be represented through code and models.

I enjoy working at the intersection of:
- software engineering  
- systems thinking  
- social and economic modelling  
- simulation and experimentation

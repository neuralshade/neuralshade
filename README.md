## Hi, I’m Jairo 👋 Computer Scientist, Computational Social Modeller

I’m a software developer who enjoys thinking about society as a system and translating those ideas into **mathematical and computational models**.

I work mainly with **Java** and **Python**, focusing on backend development, simulations, and exploratory modelling. I’m especially interested in how **social, economic, and ideological dynamics** emerge from simple rules and feedback loops.

I studied **Computer Science** at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC). Although I didn’t complete the degree, that path shaped how I think about problems: structurally, analytically, and through code.

Currently, I’m building **personal SaaS projects**, sharpening my backend skills, and experimenting with models that sit at the intersection of:
- Software engineering  
- Systems thinking  
- Social modelling

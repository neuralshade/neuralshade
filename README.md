## Hello, I’m Jairo 👋 Computer Scientist, Computational Social Modeller, Group Dynamics Researcher

I’m a programmer who likes to think about society in a different way, looking for patterns. I enjoy translating these ideas into mathematical and computational models.

I use Java and Python in my projects, and I believe these languages are very useful for me. By using them, I can develop personal projects and simulations of my social mathematical models.

I studied **Computer Science** and **Computer Networks** at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC). I did not complete the degree.

Currently, I develop private projects that use GCP as infrastructure and Python as the base language. I also have repositories with simulations of computational social models.
